# Motion Design & Animations

This document outlines the motion design and animations to be used on the billyracxx.com website.

## General Principles

*   **Subtle & Sophisticated:** Animations should be subtle and sophisticated, enhancing the user experience without being distracting.
*   **Performant:** All animations should be optimized for performance to ensure a smooth experience on all devices.
*   **On-brand:** The motion design should be consistent with the artist's brand and the overall aesthetic of the website.

## Specific Animations

### 1. Page Transitions

*   **Type:** Fade-in/fade-out with a slight blur effect.
*   **Duration:** 300ms
*   **Easing:** Ease-in-out

### 2. Hover Effects

*   **Buttons:** Slight scale-up (1.05x) and a subtle box-shadow.
*   **Links:** Underline animation that draws from left to right.
*   **Images:** Slight zoom-in effect.

### 3. Loading Animations

*   **Initial Load:** A custom loading animation featuring the artist's logo.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Images and other content will fade in as they are loaded.

### 4. Parallax Scrolling

*   **Main Page:** The background image will scroll at a slower rate than the foreground content, creating a sense of depth.

### 5. Video Backgrounds

*   **Main Page:** A subtle, looping video will be used as the background for the main hero section.

### 6. Countdown Timers

*   **Main Page:** The countdown timers will have a flip-clock animation.
